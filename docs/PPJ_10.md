## Tasks
- 1 hr: Added particle effects to chest and lamp
- 1.5 hr: Preparation and Playtesting

## Blog
Unfortuantely, I had a pretty busy week this week for other classes and didn't get to do as much as I would have liked for the playtest. Regardless, I think it went fairly smoothly and we still got good feedback from both the new and returning playtesters.

## Milestones
The playtest report 2 was due today. As I mentioned in my blog, despite some minor hiccups in the beginning, the playtest period itself went quite smoothly with minimal hiccups, and we got some helpful feedback out of it.

## Looking Ahead
I'd like to look into creating custom shaders soon, as that is a big portion of my milestone 3 grade.
